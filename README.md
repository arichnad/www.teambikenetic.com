### Who is Team Bikenetic?

![Jan shredding, 2018](https://scontent-ort2-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/2d2516aa59470ad3c2f8bacf935da5e6/5B9CBD4C/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/30602983_172308840139534_590628127131041792_n.jpg)

We’re a cyclocross and mountain bike racing team in the Washington DC area. Basically, we have fun in dirt. But we also do lots of public service and outreach: [MORE](http://www.more-mtb.org/) trail-building, [Bike to Work Day](https://www.biketoworkmetrodc.org/) support, [WABA](http://www.waba.org/) advocacy, and [Phoenix Bikes](http://www.phoenixbikes.org/) volunteering.

We started in 2014 with 25 members and now enjoy the pleasant company of ~75. We’re currently the size we want to be, but if you’re interested, get to know us at races and on rides, hang out with us, and let’s see if we’re a good fit for each other. Membership requires a stated annual commitment to racing and volunteering. For our ongoing activity, check us out on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/bikeneticx) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/teambikenetic/).

Currently we run two annual events:

- [Dirty BikenetiCrit](https://www.bikereg.com/DirtyBikenetiCrit): August 19, 2018 - our gravel crit (licened as a USAC road race)
    - [2018 results](https://www.road-results.com/race/10775)
