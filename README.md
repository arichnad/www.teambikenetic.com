### Who is Team Bikenetic?

![Stearman ripping, 2018](https://scontent-dfw5-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/40126151_2188502391191397_8011410507342807040_o.jpg?_nc_cat=0&oh=2c04c9a3bb11217e67ae65f53d978bdc&oe=5C1DE27F)

We’re a cyclocross and mountain bike racing team in the Washington DC area. Basically, we have fun in dirt. But we also do lots of public service and outreach: [MORE](http://www.more-mtb.org/) trail-building, [Bike to Work Day](https://www.biketoworkmetrodc.org/) support, [WABA](http://www.waba.org/) advocacy, and [Phoenix Bikes](http://www.phoenixbikes.org/) volunteering.

We started in 2014 with 25 members and now enjoy the pleasant company of ~75. We’re currently the size we want to be, but if you’re interested, get to know us at races and on rides, hang out with us, and let’s see if we’re a good fit for each other. Membership requires a stated annual commitment to racing and volunteering. For our ongoing activity, check us out on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/bikeneticx) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/teambikenetic/).

Currently we run two annual events:

- [BikeneticX Cyclocross](https://www.bikereg.com/37544): November 18, 2018 - our annual CX race has recently joined the [BikeReg Cyclocross Super Series](https://www.facebook.com/Super8cyclocross/)
