### Who is Team Bikenetic?

We’re a Cyclocross & Mountain Bike racing team in the Washington DC area. Basically, we have fun in dirt. But we also do lots of public service and outreach:  MORE trail-building, Bike to Work support, WABA advocacy, and Phoenix Bikes volunteering.

We started in 2014 with 25 members and now enjoy the pleasant company of ~75. We’re currently the size we want to be, but if you’re interested, get to know us at races and on rides, hang out with us, and let’s see if we’re a good fit for each other. Membership requires a stated annual commitment to racing and volunteering. For our ongoing activity, check out our Facebook page.

We’re sponsored & fully supported by Bikenetic Full Service Bike Shop, 201 West Jefferson St, Falls Church VA 22046, phone 703-Keg-Ride (really). Check them out on Facebook. Thanks to Bikenetic, we also enjoy superb equipment sponsorship from Kona, Jamis, Raleigh, and all locally with all kinds of support from Stahl Homes LLC, Cafe Kindred, and Clare and Don's Beach Shack in downtown Falls Church.
