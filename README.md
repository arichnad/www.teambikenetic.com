We’re a cyclocross and mountain bike racing team in the Washington DC area. Basically, we have fun in dirt. But we also do lots of public service and outreach: [MORE](http://www.more-mtb.org/) trail-building, [Bike to Work Day](https://www.biketoworkmetrodc.org/) support, [WABA](http://www.waba.org/) advocacy, and [Phoenix Bikes](http://www.phoenixbikes.org/) volunteering.

We started in 2014 with 25 members and now enjoy the pleasant company of ~75. We’re currently the size we want to be, but if you’re interested, get to know us at races and on rides, hang out with us, and let’s see if we’re a good fit for each other. Membership requires a stated annual commitment to racing and volunteering. For our ongoing activity, check us out on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/teambikenetic/) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/teambikenetic/).

Currently we run two annual events:

- [Dirty BikenetiCrit](https://www.facebook.com/DirtyBikenetiCrit/): August - our road race that is actually a gravel race
- [Bikeneticx Cyclocross](https://www.facebook.com/bikeneticx/): November - our annual CX race has recently joined the [BikeReg Cyclocross Super Series](https://www.facebook.com/Super8cyclocross/)

We’re sponsored & fully supported by Bikenetic Full Service Bike Shop, 201 West Jefferson St, Falls Church VA 22046, phone 703-Keg-Ride (really). Check them out on Facebook. Thanks to Bikenetic, we also enjoy superb equipment sponsorship from [Rolf Prima](https://rolfprima.com/), Kona, Jamis, Raleigh, in addition to excellent local support from Falls Church businesses: Stahl Homes LLC, Cafe Kindred, and Clare and Don's Beach Shack.
